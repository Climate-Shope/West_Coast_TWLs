Matlab files used for stationary Extreme value analysis
Codes: gev.m, createIndependentEventGeneric.m, negloglikgev.m,negloglikgpd.m, negloglikgpd2.m, block.m

These codeswere developed to fit extreme value distributions to the datasets using two different methodologies,
the Block (Annual) Maxima Method (AMM) and the PeakOver Threshold (POT) method (see Coles, 2001 for 
more information on extreme value techniques).
