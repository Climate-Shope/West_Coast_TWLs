For use with Template folder to generate TWL values

All scripts wihtin this folder should be run in order starting with
M0 and Proceeding to M8 with smaller steps in between. 

Step 1 cast transects

Order:
M0_Smooth_Shoreline
M1a_Cast_Transects_From_DEM
M1b_Order_line_segements
M1c_compare_remove_points 
M1d_Generate_Updated_Transects

Step 2 interpolate elevation profiles

Order
M2a_Calculate_Offshore_Points
M2b_interp_SWAN

Step 6 Extreme value analysis

Order

Step 7 Calculate first overtopping regime 

Order (These are iterative corrections to Overtopping Regimes and Runup values)
M8a_Overtopping_Regime_Iteration1 <--------- First attempt at determining Overtopping Regime

Step 8 Reassessment of TWL calculations

Order
M7a_Tweak_Runup_Iteration1 <--------- First pass to correct Runup errors
M8b_Overtopping_Regime_Iteration2 <--------- Second pass to correct Overtopping Regime errors

Step 9 Final reassessmnet of TWL calculations

Order
M7b_Tweak_Runup_Iteration2 <--------- Second pass to correct Runup errors
M8c_Overtopping_Regime_Iteration3 <--------- Last pass to correct Overtopping Regime errors from first 2 



Step 10 Generate Output Text files

Order
M9_Generate_RP_txt_Files


Step 11 Correct Small Erros in Retun Period Text Files

Order

M10a_Update_Probabilities_for_overwash <--------- Corrects where Overwash probabilities are erroneous
M10b_Outlier_Analysis <--------- Performs a simple outlier analysis to remove transects with excessively high TWL estimates

Other files in Template Folder include those generated by
the above scripts for temporary use and can be ignored when
running the above. The one exception is the "Douglas_TS_Input"
file that is for use with M3a_reconstruct_timeseries_nearshore_B.
This file can be offloaded to another computer for wave 
time series computation.
